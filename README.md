# Weather-App2
A functional Weather App

This is a responsive Weather App that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and OpenWeather API.

This App uses third party APIs to retrieve weather data from specified Cities according to User imput.

How to use:  Click on the imput box.  Enter in a City name.  Click the Submit Button.  The data returned and displayed will be temperature highs and lows as well as weather conditions.

I learned the basics of connecting and using APIs to retrieve data, linking HTML and Javascript data and using the Fetch method.
